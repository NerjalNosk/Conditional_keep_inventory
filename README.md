<h2 align="center" style="color:#bbf">The Conditional Keep Inventory Mod</h2>

Have you ever wanted to avoid loosing forever your stuff in some critical situations, but not to have the Keep Inventory set to true for all death?

Haven't we all hoped not to lose our stuff to a slip in the void yet without losing the thrill to go get it back without dying again when killed by some mob in a deep cave?

Well then despair no more! Because I right here have the perfect solution for you!

I hereby present you... the **Conditional Keep Inventory** mod!

<h3 style="color:#fbb">What it does</h3>

This mod intends to allow you to choose as exactly as you want when should the Keep Inventory apply, and when shall it not.

Through a config file and a command, I have made this mod so that you can set both a whitelist and a blacklist of conditions, which would condition whether the Keep Inventory can, or not, apply.
