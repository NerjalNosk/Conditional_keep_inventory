# Config file examples

### Warning! Here be dragons!

These files are examples of how you could set up your config in order to perform some conditions or others.<br>
Beware! Since the 1.0.0 version is no more supported (and there is the 1.1.x mod version for Mc1.17), no config version
will be given for that mod version.
(Also, a few flaws that I am *NOT* going to work on have appeared with the 1.0.0, so use at your own risks)

### Config examples

* **Keep All** > When you don't want your stuff to disappear by any mean 
[keep_all_from_destruction](keep_all_from_destruction) (warning. Until v1.1.0, explosions aren't fully handled.
Your stuff still might disappear in a chain reaction)
* *And more to come, just ask for it. I might as well add some submitted in comments and discussions*
